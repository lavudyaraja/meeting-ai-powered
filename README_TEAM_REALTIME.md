# Team Management Real-Time Implementation

## Overview
This implementation replaces the mock data in the team management components with real-time data from Supabase, providing a fully functional team management system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
Created `supabase/migrations/20251005200000_create_team_tables.sql` with:
- `departments` table for organizing team members
- `roles` table for defining permissions
- `team_members` table for managing user assignments
- Default system roles (Owner, Admin, Manager, Member, Guest)

### 2. Supabase Types
Updated `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` to include the new tables:
- Added `departments` table type
- Added `roles` table type
- Added `team_members` table type with proper relationships

### 3. Custom Hooks
Created `src/hooks/use-team.ts` with:
- Real-time data fetching for departments, roles, and team members
- CRUD operations for all team entities
- Real-time subscriptions using Supabase postgres changes
- Proper error handling and loading states

Created `src/hooks/use-auth.ts` with:
- User session management
- Authentication state tracking

### 4. Component Updates
Updated all team management components to use real-time data:
- `src/components/dashboard/team/TeamManagement.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/team/DepartmentManagement.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/team/RoleManagement.tsx`

## How to Apply Changes

1. Run the database migration:
   ```bash
   cd supabase
   npx supabase migration up
   ```

2. If you're using a remote Supabase project, deploy the migration:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push
   ```

3. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Features Implemented

### Real-Time Updates
- All team data updates automatically when changes occur
- No need to refresh the page to see new members, departments, or roles
- Instant feedback when making changes

### Full CRUD Operations

## Technical Details

### Data Relationships
- Departments can have multiple team members
- Roles can be assigned to multiple team members
- Team members belong to one department and have one role
- All relationships are properly maintained in the UI

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient real-time subscriptions with minimal overhead
- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Optimized data fetching with single queries
- Memoized filter and sort operations

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for all operations
- User-friendly error messages

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Navigate to the Team Management section in the dashboard
2. Add a new department and verify it appears in real-time
3. Create a custom role with specific permissions
4. Add team members and assign them to departments and roles
5. Verify all changes are reflected immediately across all components
